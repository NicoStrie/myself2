                  <p>
                    As part of my work with <strong>Emil Frey Digital</strong>, I was responsible for designing and deploying a robust analytics setup across localized websites for multiple automotive brands, including <strong>Opel, Toyota, Kia, and Suzuki</strong>. These platforms served as <em>vehicle marketplaces</em>—dynamic digital environments where users could browse inventory, compare vehicle configurations, and initiate purchases or inquiries.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The initiative was ambitious in scale and complexity. Each brand had distinct requirements, localized content, and customer journeys, yet we needed a <strong>unified and scalable analytics solution</strong> that ensured data quality, consistency, and actionable insights across all touchpoints.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Writing the Implementation Guide & DataLayer Architecture</h4>
                  <p>
                    One of my core contributions was authoring a <strong>comprehensive Implementation Guide</strong> that served as the central reference for analytics across all brand websites. This document defined the data strategy, tracking logic, naming conventions, and governance rules. It was essential in aligning cross-functional teams—developers, analysts, marketers, and external partners—on a single source of truth.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    At the heart of this setup was a <strong>custom DataLayer</strong>, engineered to adhere to the <em>best practices of e-commerce tracking</em>. Unlike typical product catalog tracking, vehicles come with a rich set of attributes—such as <strong>model, brand, fuel type, color, horsepower (PS), transmission, and mileage</strong>. I ensured these attributes were systematically captured in the DataLayer for each vehicle listing, enabling both granular analysis and high-resolution segmentation.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Tagging Infrastructure: GTM, GA4, and Conversion Tracking</h4>
                  <p>
                    To bring this vision to life, I implemented a <strong>centralized Google Tag Manager (GTM) setup</strong> that allowed us to manage tags efficiently across multiple brand websites, while maintaining flexibility for localized adjustments. I built modular and reusable tag templates, with triggers and variables tailored for a variety of user interactions—from basic pageviews to advanced behaviors like vehicle comparisons, lead form submissions, and vehicle detail impressions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I also led the full <strong>integration of Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</strong>, configuring custom events to track all key engagement points and ecommerce actions. Given GA4’s flexibility with event parameters, I made sure we passed all relevant vehicle attributes, which later proved vital for both behavioral analysis and audience segmentation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Additionally, I established integrations with key <strong>advertising and remarketing platforms</strong>, ensuring we could <em>feed enriched behavioral and product-level data</em> into tools such as Google Ads and Meta Ads. This enabled us to build powerful remarketing audiences—for example, users who viewed only hybrid vehicles with 150+ PS or those who interacted with specific models in particular geographic regions.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Unlocking Insights & Optimizing Ad Spend</h4>
                  <p>
                    The long-term goal of this analytics setup wasn’t just tracking for the sake of reporting—it was about <strong>activating data to drive performance</strong>.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Build <strong>micro-audiences</strong> based on user interest and vehicle features</li>
                    <li>Launch <strong>dynamic remarketing campaigns</strong> with real vehicle data</li>
                    <li>Improve ad efficiency through <strong>high-quality event & product data</strong></li>
                    <li>Enable <strong>predictive modeling</strong> for churn prediction and lead scoring</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Campaigns targeting vehicle-specific audiences saw a measurable <strong>lift in CTR and lower CPCs</strong>, and retargeting lists became significantly more relevant and effective.
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Collaboration and Ownership</h4>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the project, I acted as the <strong>bridge between technical and business teams</strong>—translating strategic marketing goals into implementable technical solutions. I worked closely with developers during implementation, QA teams for testing data accuracy, and marketing stakeholders to define KPIs and optimize campaign structures based on the analytics data.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mt-4">
                    By delivering both the technical foundation and the operational processes to support it, I helped Emil Frey Digital and its partner brands move toward a <strong>truly data-informed marketing ecosystem</strong>, scalable across markets and adaptable to evolving business goals.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mt-4">
                    <em>This project highlighted not just my proficiency with tools like <strong>Google Tag Manager and GA4</strong>, but also my ability to architect large-scale tracking systems, translate complex data into strategic insights, and drive cross-functional collaboration to execute those insights into business value.</em>
